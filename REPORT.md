# Autonomous Space Debris AI & Trajectory Tracking Engine 
**Research-Grade Systems Engineering Report**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the architectural deployment of a robust, research-grade Space Situational Awareness (SSA) AI platform. The system operates natively utilizing active `CelesTrak TLE (Two-Line Element)` open datasets, devoid of black-box commercial API dependencies. It actively predicts potential catastrophic conjunctions (collisions) using machine learning and automatically visualizes deterministic removal intercepts using structural `SGP4` numerical propagators and autonomous Reinforcement Learning.

## 2. Core Operational Modules

The codebase is segregated into the following independent logic systems mapped directly within the deployment orchestration graph:

### 2.1 Physics & State Propagation (`simulation/`)
The foundational layer converts abstract satellite strings into hard coordinate systems mapping the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) environment:
- **`SGP4 Integrator`**: Accurately computes $X,Y,Z$ positional vectors and $V_X,V_Y,V_Z$ velocity matrices accounting for the gravitational anomaly $J_2$ and basic orbital mechanics. 
- **`State Tracking`**: Separates active operational satellites (cataloged natively) from dangerous decaying space debris fields. 

### 2.2 Deep Learning Tracking & Avoidance (`prediction/` & `collision/`)
- **`6D Kalman State Filter`**: Before neural prediction, synthetic telemetry observations are smoothed through a continuous state filter to nullify hypothetical measurement noise. 
- **`Seq2Seq LSTM Predictor`**: A PyTorch network trained explicitly on the orbital sequences generated by the physics engine, designed to forecast future 3D positional deviations ($t_{n+1}...t_{n+k}$).
- **`XGBoost Assessor`**: Processes absolute relative distances and high-speed closure velocities to output a discrete statistical risk classification (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`). 

### 2.3 RL Maneuver Logic (`avoidance/`)
- **`Stable-Baselines3 PPO`**: A deeply trained Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement agent. The agent is strictly commanded to generate optimized $\Delta V$ evasive thrusting vectors (burns) only when the XGBoost boundary outputs a `HIGH` risk vector.

## 3. Autonomous Active Removal Sandbox

Driven by the need for proactive space environmentalism, a parallel **Simulation Array** was engineered internally within the `removal_logic/` directory.

### 3.1 AI Interception Pathfinding
- **Target Selection**: The AI scans the universal SGP4 position tensor array computing real-time Euclidean distances to locate the absolute closest structural debris target relative to the launch vector.
- **Flight Trajectory**: Calculates a dynamic, continuous interception spline updating with every $\Delta t$ epoch step, factoring in theoretical intercept speeds to animate the Rocket closing the distance natively on the grid.

### 3.2 Immersive 3D Plotly UI 
Using `plotly.graph_objects`, the dashboard maps a fully spherical interactive mapping of the current Celestrak state:
* 🟢 **Active Objects**: The tracked operational satellites.
* 🔴 **Space Debris Fields**: Known non-operational bodies.
* 🟡 **Selected Target**: The targeted artifact identified mechanically by the AI module locking on for removal.
* 🔵 **AI Interceptor**: The dynamically dispatched rocket generating continuous $\Delta V$ telemetry across the spatial grid. 

## 4. Execution Pipeline & User Interface

The system is deployed interactively via `Streamlit`. The entire UI (`main.py`) acts natively as the central orchestrator, updating the visualization payload strictly off the math modules defined above. 

To execute the core platform, navigate to the `space-debris-ai` directory and execute the local server wrapper:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
* **Tab 1: 3D Simulation**: Maps a static observation graph of a randomized subset of the SGP4 physics state.
* **Tab 2: Metrics Validation**: Outputs ablation graphs explicitly analyzing system resilience omitting the Kalman Filter and substituting Linear Extrapolations for the LSTM network. 
* **Tab 3: True E2E Output**: Represents the unified data structure pipeline: `Proxy Image -> Filter -> LSTM -> XGBoost -> Avoidance maneuver`. 
* **Tab 4: Autonomous Removal Sim**: Executes the continuous Plotly animation tracking the dispatched rocket automatically harvesting the nearest available debris target directly within the live browser DOM.
