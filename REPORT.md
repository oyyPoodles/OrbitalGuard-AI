# Autonomous Space Debris AI & Trajectory Tracking Engine 
**Research-Grade Systems Engineering Report**

---

## 1. Problem Statement

To develop an AI-powered end-to-end Space Situational Awareness system that leverages physics-based orbital simulation and machine learning to detect, track, predict, and mitigate space debris, while also simulating autonomous debris removal using intelligent trajectory planning and real-time visualization.

---

## 2. Executive Summary

This report documents the architectural deployment of a robust, research-grade Space Situational Awareness (SSA) AI platform. The system operates natively utilizing active `CelesTrak TLE (Two-Line Element)` open datasets, devoid of black-box commercial API dependencies. It actively predicts potential catastrophic conjunctions (collisions) using machine learning and automatically visualizes deterministic removal intercepts using structural `SGP4` numerical propagators and autonomous Reinforcement Learning.

## 3. System Architecture

The OrbitalGuard AI platform is built upon a modular architecture decoupling physics simulation from machine learning inference. The system relies on TLE orbital parameters ingested into an SGP4 propagator to calculate true 3D spatial positioning. Real-time Cartesian states are processed through filtering algorithms and deep learning pipelines for conjunction assessment. Finally, evasive maneuvers and autonomous removal trajectories are computed using reinforcement learning methodologies and deterministic pathfinding, continuously visualized through an interactive Streamlit and Plotly dashboard.

## 4. Modules

The codebase is segregated into the following independent logic systems mapped directly within the deployment orchestration graph:

### 4.1 Physics & State Propagation (`simulation/`)
The foundational layer converts abstract satellite strings into hard coordinate systems mapping the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) environment:
- **`SGP4 Integrator`**: Accurately computes $X,Y,Z$ positional vectors and $V_X,V_Y,V_Z$ velocity matrices accounting for the gravitational anomaly $J_2$ and basic orbital mechanics. 
- **`State Tracking`**: Separates active operational satellites (cataloged natively) from dangerous decaying space debris fields. 

### 4.2 Deep Learning Tracking & Avoidance (`prediction/` & `collision/`)
- **`6D Kalman State Filter`**: Before neural prediction, synthetic telemetry observations are smoothed through a continuous state filter to nullify hypothetical measurement noise. 
- **`Seq2Seq LSTM Predictor`**: A PyTorch network trained explicitly on the orbital sequences generated by the physics engine, designed to forecast future 3D positional deviations ($t_{n+1}...t_{n+k}$).
- **`XGBoost Assessor`**: Processes absolute relative distances and high-speed closure velocities to output a discrete statistical risk classification (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`). 

### 4.3 RL Maneuver Logic (`avoidance/`)
- **`Stable-Baselines3 PPO`**: A deeply trained Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement agent. The agent is strictly commanded to generate optimized $\Delta V$ evasive thrusting vectors (burns) only when the XGBoost boundary outputs a `HIGH` risk vector. 

### 4.4 Autonomous Active Removal Sandbox
Driven by the need for proactive space environmentalism, a parallel **Simulation Array** was engineered internally within the `removal_logic/` directory.

- **AI Interception Pathfinding**: 
  - **Target Selection**: The AI scans the universal SGP4 position tensor array computing real-time Euclidean distances to locate the absolute closest structural debris target relative to the launch vector.
  - **Flight Trajectory**: Calculates a dynamic, continuous interception spline updating with every $\Delta t$ epoch step, factoring in theoretical intercept speeds to animate the Rocket closing the distance natively on the grid.

### 4.5 Execution Pipeline & User Interface
The system is deployed interactively via `Streamlit`. The entire UI (`main.py`) acts natively as the central orchestrator, updating the visualization payload strictly off the math modules defined above. 

To execute the core platform, navigate to the `space-debris-ai` directory and execute the local server wrapper:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
* **Tab 1: 3D Simulation**: Maps a static observation graph of a randomized subset of the SGP4 physics state.
* **Tab 2: Metrics Validation**: Outputs ablation graphs explicitly analyzing system resilience omitting the Kalman Filter and substituting Linear Extrapolations for the LSTM network. 
* **Tab 3: True E2E Output**: Represents the unified data structure pipeline: `Proxy Image -> Filter -> LSTM -> XGBoost -> Avoidance maneuver`. 
* **Tab 4: Autonomous Removal Sim**: Executes the continuous Plotly animation tracking the dispatched rocket automatically harvesting the nearest available debris target directly within the live browser DOM.

## 5. End-to-End Flow

The pipeline executes sequentially to transform open-source telemetry into proactive intelligent tracking and avoidance:

1. **Space Object Initialization (TLE → SGP4)**: Raw TLE data is ingested and processed by the SGP4 propagator to derive actual state vectors (Position, Velocity).
2. **Environment Simulation (3D Environment)**: A fully spherical mapping of the LEO environment is established to host all active satellites and debris. 
3. **Synthetic Optical Detection (YOLO)**: A simulated YOLO-based detection proxy processes spatial rendering output to mock visual recognition of orbiting objects.
4. **State Estimation (Kalman Filter)**: Ingested telemetry states are filtered to effectively reduce Gaussian simulation noise, enhancing coordinate reliability. 
5. **Trajectory Forecasting (LSTM)**: Sequential state data is fed into a Long Short-Term Memory temporal network predicting precise future spatial deviations over $T$ steps.
6. **Conjunction Assessment (XGBoost)**: Predictions are cross-referenced evaluating proximity and relative velocity. The XGBoost classifier assesses conjunction risks and outputs a discrete threat classification matrix.
7. **Evasive Maneuvers (PPO)**: Should a `HIGH` risk be assessed, the PPO Reinforcement Learning model outputs a computed optimal $\Delta V$ thrust command to evade intersection securely.
8. **Removal Simulation**: Computes autonomous capture mechanics, pathfinding, and dynamic trajectory intercepts for targeted debris elements using deterministic updates in the secondary grid sandbox.
9. **Interactive Output (Visualization)**: Processed states, predicted splines, and execution models are rendered in an interactive 3D frontend via Streamlit and Plotly.

## 6. Detection Model Justification

The current YOLO implementation operates as an explicitly **simulated optical detection pipeline**. 
- **Operational Reality**: In authentic SSA field operations, space debris detection generally leverages advanced ground-based phased array radar infrastructures and extensive electro-optical space telescope networks. 
- **Simulation Efficacy**: The integrated YOLO proxy within this framework effectively simulates an active vision-based tracking apparatus. It enables end-to-end validation of the subsequent mathematical tracking operations and AI pipeline without requiring access to strictly classified or immensely expensive proprietary tracking sensors.

## 7. Results & Performance

Comprehensive testing and validation of the integrated modules illustrate resilient capabilities:

* **LSTM Trajectory Prediction**: Outperformed standardized linear extrapolation significantly, yielding reduced drift errors effectively modeling curvilinear path behavior over longer temporal forecasting horizons.
* **Kalman Noise Reduction**: Significantly improved raw state coordinate stability, producing high-fidelity positional estimations before neural injection by successfully flattening synthetically introduced telemetry jitter. 
* **XGBoost Classification Accuracy**: Showcased robust precision separating `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `HIGH` risk threats relying heavily on multi-variable inputs leveraging combined velocity vectors and absolute minimal encounter distances.
* **PPO Avoidance Effectiveness**: Generated efficient thrust commands capable of diverging the satellite from projected collision cylinders while conservatively minimizing total assumed $\Delta V$ propellant expenditure.
* **Removal Interception**: Successfully and deterministically locked onto prioritized debris fragments, reliably closing the simulated relative distance and animating the geometric approach effectively on the dynamic spatial grid.

## 8. Limitations

Despite achieving targeted system logic, the pipeline has strictly defined constraints primarily reflecting software-bounded design scopes:

* **Simulated Detection**: The pipeline heavily relies on synthetic target detection mechanics opposed to ingesting true optical sensor/radar input data.
* **Simplified Orbital Physics**: Utilizing an SGP4 propagator without integrating advanced high-order perturbation factors (e.g., precise atmospheric drag models, solar radiation pressure, lunar/solar gravity). 
* **RL Constrained Environment**: The avoidance PPO execution acts in a constrained, heavily idealized reward environment which may fail to translate effectively over non-deterministic control variables.
* **Conceptual Debris Removal**: The AI tracking intercept is primarily a deterministic pathfinding simulation, serving as a conceptual demonstration lacking detailed structural capture mechanics or precise relative rendezvous docking physics.
